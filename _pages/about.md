I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Lab126, driving innovation in edge computing, wireless and mobile sensing, and their integration with Alexa’s Gen AI models. I specialize in sensing technologies for IoT devices and have developed advanced solutions for smart home systems, proximity-based interactions, and real-time indoor localization. As a founding member of the team building Alexa’s spatial awareness capabilities, I focus on enhancing IoT experiences by combining advanced sensing with practical applications—making AI smarter about physical presence and the real world to create seamless, intelligent environments.

Prior to Amazon, I was a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by Prof. Romit Roy Choudhury. My thesis focused on problems in mobile and wearable computing, wireless sensing, user tracking, and indoor localization. 

Previously, I received my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT-Delhi India, where I worked on problems in Mobile Computing and Sensing in Online Networks, advised by Prof. Vinayak Naik and Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru (PK).

My research interests lie in Mobile and Wearable Computing, Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing, Indoor Localization and User Tracking, Wireless and RF Sensing, Applications of Machine Learning in the context of Internet-of-Everything (IoE), Data Mining, and Applied AI.

Over the past decade, I have had the opportunity to be affiliated with multiple research organizations— Microsoft Research, IBM Research, Xerox Research, RSA Security, Signals and Inference Research Group (SiNRG @ UIUC), PreCog Research Group (PreCog @ IIIT-Delhi), and Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing Group (MUC @ IIIT-Delhi).
